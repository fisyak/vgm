=========================================
  16/08/2007
  version 3.00
               New packages: AgddGM, autoconf.
               
               In XmlVGM:
               - Updated GDML exporter with new GDML version
               - Adding export of Boolean solids in AGDD.
               
               All:
               - Adding GPL licence and copyright.
               - Added ExtrudedSolid
               - IMaterial::AtomsCount(int) now returns double (was int);
                 Corrected Material::AtomCount in eant4GM, RootGM to be 
                 consistent with AgddGM
               
               Tested with CLHEP 2.0.3.1, Root 5.16/00, Geant4 9.0,

               Linux: gcc 4.1.1 (FC6)
               To be tested: MacOS Powerbook 10.4.7 gcc 4 (CMT version)

  22/05/2007
  version 2.09
               Tested with CLHEP 2.0.3.1, Root 5.15/04, Geant4 8.2.p01;

  23/03/2007
  version 2.09.pre 
               In VGM
               - Adding new interfaces for support of chemical elements
               composed from isotopes 
               - Adding an interface to create element via Z
               using a predefined element table of the geometry
               model (NIST material table in Geant4, its own element
               table in Root)
                
               In Geant4GM:
               Consistent use of G4 reflection factory for all placements
               and divisions (Fixes a problem with missing daughters
               observed on ALICE geometry, got from conversion
               Root -> Geant4) 
            
               In XmlVGM:
               - Implemented export of media & materials (including elements 
                 and isotopes)
               - AGDD: Update to dtdVersion v7
               - GDML: Exporting full lengths of solid instead of half lenghts
               
               In test:
               Adding test with tracking particles;
               consolidated test geometries (volume names, worls volume size)
               and fixed a few differences in geometry definitions. 
               
               Tested with CLHEP 2.0.3.1, Root 5.15/04, Geant4 8.2.p01;
               Linux: gcc 4.1.1 (FC6)

  version 2.08.04 
               In RootGM:
                - Material state, temperature and pressure
               stored now directly in TGeoMaterial, their default
               values are defined by TGeo, too. 
               - By default use user defined elements (may be different
               from TGeo elements return from material; possibility
               to use Teo elements kepts as an option. 
               - Now importingtop node (was volume in previous version)
               In BaseVGM: 
               - Export copyNo of the world volume (was set to 0
               in the previous version);

              - Ported to MacOS (thanks to Laurent Garnier, LAL)
	      - Added CMT configuration file (Laurent Garnier, LAL)
              - Added test for assemblies with reflections, the first test for
