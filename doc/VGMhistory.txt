 The Virtual Geometry Model - Versions
=========================================
  05/07/2006
  version 2.08    (public version)
              - Added support for Ctubs solid (cut tube);
                in Geant4 the solid is realised via Boolean operations
              - Added installation scripts to examples
              - Ported to MacOS (thanks to Laurent Garnier, LAL)
	      - Added CMT configuration file (Laurent Garnier, LAL)
              - Added test for assemblies with reflections, the first test for 
                assemblies now includes assemblies of assemblies 
                (available in Geant4 from version 8.1)
              - Fixes:
                - Corrected export of reflected boolean solids (in G4->Root way)
                - Import from Root geometry containing not placed volumes
                - Multiple placement (division) offset in Geant4

  version 2.00.00  
	       Restructured source into independent packages:
                  source -> packages with:
	  	  VGM       - interfaces
		  BaseVGM   - common implementation
		  Geant4GM  - VGM implementation for Geant4
		  RootGM    - VGM implementation for Root TGeo
		  XmlVGM    - XML eporters

               Introduced namespaces per package;
	       the name of namespace = name of package.
