 The Virtual Geometry Model - Installation
=================================================
 
 Environment:
 -----------
   The following environment variables have to be set by user:
   VGM_INSTALL     - path to VGM installation
   VGM_SYSTEM      - platform (Linux-g++, SunOS, DEC-cxx, HP-aCC)
   CLHEP_BASE_DIR  - path to CLHEP installation

   In order to use VGM with Geant4 and/or Root,
   the environment for these packages has to be set in a standard
   way.
   If G4INSTALL and/or ROOTSYS environment variables are set,
   the Geant4 VGM and/or Root VGM are built automatically.
   User can exclude it from compilation by setting variables:
   VGM_NO_GEANT4 - do not build Geant4 VGM
   VGM_NO_ROOT   - do not build Root VGM

   The default environment setting (for VGM only) is provided 
   in the config/setup.(c)sh script.   
  
 Compilation:
 -----------
   cd $VGM_INSTALL/packages
   gmake                - build libraries 
                          (in $VGM_INSTALL/lib/$VGM_SYSTEM)
 

 Test:
 -----
   To build test program:
   cd $VGM_INSTALL/test
   source env_setup.csh
   gmake
   
   For different test options, see vgm/test/README file;
   eg.
   vgm_test VGM Geant4 Root noXML Solids

 Examples:
 ---------
   To build examples, see README in the example directory. 
 
 Tested platform:
